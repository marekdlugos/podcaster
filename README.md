# Podcaster ðŸŽ§
Host and publish your podcasts on Github for free.

## Goal
Eventually, I'd like to create a repo which anyone can fork to go ahead and start publishing their podcast.
The idea would be to provide all the essentials a podcast needs:
1. Place to upload the raw files to (in this case Github).
2. A landing page for your podcast.
3. An XML feed for the podcast services.
4. An easy way/guide to publish your podcasts moving forward.

## Hypothesis
1. Use something like Jekyll or Hugo to manage what people will see.
2. Get inspired by websites like [Remote Ruby](https://remoteruby.com/) or [Transmit template](https://tailwindui.com/templates/transmit)
3. Figure how how easy/difficult it is to set up [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) and provide a clear guidance for the folks out there.
4. Provide a clear guidance on how to set the whole thing up, customize the branding, make sure it follows best practices for podcasting.
